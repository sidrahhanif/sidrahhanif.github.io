subtitle: ML Engineer at alwaysAI

I work at alwaysAI as a ML engineer. Recently, I developed a Bring Your Own Architecture (BYOA) software with my team at alwaysAI.
Previously, I defended by PhD dissertation in Computer Science at Temple University , Philadelphia. During my PhD, I was advised by [**Dr. Longin Jan Latecki**](https://cis.temple.edu/~latecki/). My disserttation primarily focuses on building computer vision algorithms for analyzing handwritten documents. Our work has developed a word detection algorithm for camera-captured handwritten images. We also build the strokes trajectory recovery algorithm for full-page unconstraint handwritten documents. Finally, we proposed a state-of-the-art diffusion model with multiscale attention features.
