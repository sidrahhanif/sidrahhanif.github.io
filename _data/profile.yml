    I work at alwaysAI as a ML engineer. Recently, I developed a Bring Your Own Architecture (BYOA) software with my team at alwaysAI. 
    Previously, I defended by PhD dissertation in Computer Science at Temple University , Philadelphia. During my PhD, I was advised 
    by Dr. Longin Jan Latecki. My disserttation primarily focuses on building computer vision algorithms for analyzing handwritten documents. 
    Our work has developed a word detection algorithm for camera-captured handwritten images. We also build the strokes trajectory recovery 
    algorithm for full-page unconstraint handwritten documents. Finally, we proposed a state-of-the-art diffusion model with multiscale attention
    features.
